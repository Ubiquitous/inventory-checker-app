### What is InventoryWatch?

InventoryWatch is a simple app for macOS that monitors local Apple Store inventory and notifies you when your preferred model comes in-stock. 

### Why do I need that? 

Have you tried ordering a new MacBook Pro? Or a new iPhone Pro Max? Shipping times can stretch into multiple weeks or months, and uncertainty around global supply chains can add stress to a process that would test anyone's patience. 

InventoryWatch is designed to help you jump the line: Apple Stores frequently (but irregularly) get fresh stock. When that happens, InventoryWatch will notify you immediately, so you can place an in-store pickup order and get your product in minutes instead of months. 

### Does InventoryWatch support my local store? 

InventoryWatch supports querying in-store pickup stock in seven countries:

  * United States
  * Canada
  * United Kingdom
  * Austrailia
  * Germany
  * South Korea
  * Hong Kong

* MacBook Pro (14" and 16")
* iPhone 13
* iPhone 13 mini
* iPhone 13 Pro

### System requirements?
